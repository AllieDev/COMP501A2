# Risks

While Chat GPT holds promise for future educational advancements, there are growing concerns among educators and experts about potential risks associated with its usage in the classroom. According to Allam et al (2023), the use of Chat GPT can raise privacy concerns due to the increasing collection and storage of data when interacting with the system. Similarly, some students have a tendency to use Chat GPT for academic dishonesty by cheating on their assignments and exams, such as submitting copied work without references or letting Chat GPT do their assignments (Yu, 2023). Additionally, Shwetarani (2023) stated that students might become excessively dependent on Chat GPT, resulting in a lack of critical thinking, problem-solving, and creativity. In other words, Kasneci et al (2023) also pointed out that students tend to use Chat GPT to research information and give them answers, rather than independently researching their own investigations, and this trend contributes to a growing reliance on Chat GPT among students. In some cases, Chat GPT can generate incorrect answers, depending on the complexity of the question, posing a risk to students who rely on it, potentially leading to misinformation and negatively impacting their academic performance (Baidoo-Anu et al., 2023). Moreover, Chat GPT brings ethical issues regarding the distance between AI-generated content and human-authored content. Donmez et al (2023) believed that determining the true authorship can be challenging. Therefore, it is important to establish appropriate ethical guidelines and standards when employing Chat GPT in education (Alshater, 2022).
