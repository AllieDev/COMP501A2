The integration of AI technology into education holds the potential to reshape the future of learning, offering many opportunities to enhance students’ learning experience and help them adapt to the changing needs of the future (Gozalo-Brizuela and Garrido-Merchán, 2023). Research conducted by Montenegro-Rueda et al. (2023) shows that using Chat GPT offers significant support in the teaching and learning process for both students and teachers (82%). It assists students and teachers in improving their performance, motivation, and managing their time efficiently, as well as fostering a collaborative learning environment.

On the other hand, Montenegro-Rueda et al. (2023) also highlight the notable absence of essential training programs for teachers to effectively integrate Chat GPT into education. It is important that all teachers and students know how to utilize this tool in education in a responsible way and comply with ethical guidance.

Consequently, although there are some risks involved in using chat GPT, we believe that chat GPT should be employed as an Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) to improve students’ academics. However, it is important to remember that chat GPT can't replace teachers and tutors, and educators should educate students on how to use it responsibly and alongside human instruction and support (Ribeiro & Vala, 2020, as cited in Baidoo-Anu & Owusu Ansah, 2023).
